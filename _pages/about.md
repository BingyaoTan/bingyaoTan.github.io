Welcome to my website!
I am currently a Senior research fellow at Singapore Eye Research Institute, and I hold an assistant professor position at Duke-NUS Medical School.

I am a trained optical engineer with a focus on medical imaging devices, especially Optical Coherence Tomography. I am also interested in physics informed or physiology informed generative AI.
