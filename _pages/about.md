Welcome to my website!
I am currently a Senior research fellow at Singapore Eye Research Institute, and I hold an assistant professor position at Duke-NUS Medical School.

I am a long distance runner, and I have finished 7 marathons (Toronto 2015, Montreal 2016, Ottawa 2016, Singapore 2018, Tokyo (major) 2023, Wuxi 2024, and Berlin (Major) 2024). My personal best is 3:18:16 in Berlin.

Research Interest
======
I am interested in advanced ocular imaging technologies, mathematical modeling of ocular vasculature, and physics-informed/physiology-informed generative AI.
