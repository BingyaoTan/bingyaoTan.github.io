I am currently a Senior Research Fellow at Singapore Eye Research Institute, and I hold an Assistant Professor position at Duke-NUS Medical School. 

Research Interest
======
I am interested in advanced ocular imaging technologies, mathematical modeling of ocular vasculature, and physics-informed/physiology-informed generative AI. I hold multiple and am applying for more patents in the field of medical imaging instruments, hoping these techs can accelebrate disease disgnosis and management.
