### **Figure Options**
You can replace the `src` paths (`/images/...`) with actual paths to your image files. Upload these images to your repository under an appropriate directory (e.g., `/images/`) to ensure they render properly.

---

### **How This Works**
1. **Markdown Images**:
   - Syntax: `![Alt Text](image_path)`
   - Example: `![Award Image](/images/outstanding_researcher_award.png)`

2. **Image Alignment with HTML** (optional for custom styles):
   If you need more advanced formatting (e.g., centering), you can use HTML directly:
   ```html
   <div style="text-align: center;">
       <img src="/images/award.png" alt="Award Image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
   </div>
