  2025-01: Our paper, "Masked Vascular Structure Segmentation and Completion in Retinal Images", has been accepted on IEEE TMI (IF = 8.9)! This is a work inspired by masked autoencoder. By training the neural network to learn the reconnection the simulated broken vessels, the neural network can segment the vessel with more continuous structure. Congrats to Zhou Yi for his first publication with us.
