  2025-01: Our paper, "Masked Vascular Structure Segmentation and Completion in Retinal Images", has been accepted on IEEE TMI (IF = 8.9)! By letting the neural network learn how to reconnect the broken vessels, the neural network can segment the vessel with more continuous structure. Congrats to Zhou Yi for his paper publication with us.
